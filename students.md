# For Students: Your Chance to Create

**If you love games and wonder what it’d be like to make one, this is your chance to try.**

Meeplitis is where games meet code — a place to belong if you enjoy using your mind, solving puzzles, or imagining what could be. You don’t have to be an artist or coder already. You just need curiosity and the willingness to put in steady effort.

This isn’t a competition. No leaderboards, no rivalries. Everyone here grows at their own pace.

## What We Do Together

We learn by making. That means hands-on digital projects where you see ideas turn into real things. Early belts might have you building a website or coding a classic puzzle game like [Sokoban](https://mlanza.com/sokoban/). As you level up, you’ll take on more complex challenges, like coding a realtime game in the style of [Boulder Dash](https://mlanza.com/boulder-dash/), or even creating a digital board or card game that others can play online.

These early projects may look simple compared to modern video games, but don’t mistake them for throwaway exercises. Building even a “trivial” digital game is proof you can think like a developer — the same kind of thinking that powers the most advanced games and apps. Each step sets you up for more. By the time you’ve created something like a multiplayer board game online, you’ll have demonstrated the kind of real-world skills that show you could take on tech as a career if you wanted.

Belts mark milestones along the way, celebrating progress without rushing. The aim isn’t to race, but to keep going.

### Practice Beyond the Club

Like learning piano, most of your progress won’t come in the lesson itself, but [in the time you set aside each week](./growth.md) to practice. Meetups give you direction and coaching, but it’s your steady rhythm at home that builds real skill.

## Why AI Matters

We’re living through an AI revolution. ChatGPT is one of the defining tools of this moment, and it’s the one you’ll use here. It will help you brainstorm, debug, and accelerate your learning. But AI won’t do the work for you. You’ll learn to *understand* what you build, so you can extend and adapt it later — the kind of skill real employers value.

## The Payoff

The first time you see your own website, app, or game actually work, it feels huge. It’s one of those moments you’ll remember. But getting there takes steady practice and patience — more like learning an instrument than playing a round of a game. You won’t walk in and build something big in a month, but with guidance and persistence, you’ll get there. And when you do, it’s worth it.

Each belt you earn proves a new layer of ability. By the time you’ve reached the blue belt, you’ll have shown you can deliver digital projects that make employers pay attention. That doesn’t mean you have to turn it into a career — even as a hobby, the skills you build here are valuable and lasting. But if you do see tech as part of your future, you’ll already have evidence you belong.

## The Invitation

Bring a laptop if you can. Show up curious. Try making something digital instead of only consuming it.

Meeplitis is your chance to discover whether creating websites, apps, and games can be as fun as playing them.
