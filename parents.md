# For Parents: Training Kids to See Growth As Fun

**This isn’t about shortcuts; it’s about building habits that open real doors.**

## What Meeplitis Is

In school, opportunities often cluster around athletics, band, and orchestra. But what about the creatives — the artists, the thinkers, the ones who’d rather puzzle through ideas or imagine new worlds? They’re often left without a team.

Meeplitis is a club built to fill that gap. It’s an after-school program where games meet code — students gather to play, but also to learn web development, use AI tools like ChatGPT, and create digital board games and apps of their own. It’s a safe, structured “third place” for those who want to try their hand at making instead of only consuming.

## Beyond Consumption

Kids today are raised on a steady diet of short clips, memes, and endless scrolling. It’s fun, but it doesn’t build much. Meeplitis takes that same screen time and turns it into something nourishing. Instead of only consuming, students learn to create — moving from passive entertainment to active building.

**That’s why access to a personal computer matters**. Phones and tablets invite passive swiping, but a laptop or desktop invites engagement. Sitting at a keyboard signals, *I’m here to produce, to learn, to get things done.* With the right mindset, that screen becomes a tool for focus and creation — more like an instrument than a toy.

## Concentration and Growth

At Meeplitis, projects are intentionally too big to finish in one sitting. Students have to break them down, chip away steadily, and keep going week by week. That kind of focus — sustained concentration paired with fun — is rare, but it’s what actually leads to growth.

## Play as the On-Ramp

Yes, there are board games. Yes, there’s fun. But that’s just the spark. Games are the carrot that get creative juices flowing, and soon students are learning what it takes to translate something from the real world into the digital one. That’s the essence of building apps, websites, and digital games.

## Skills That Transfer

The digital skills students practice here — coding, problem-solving, using AI tools like ChatGPT — are highly valued in today’s world. Even if your child only treats it as a hobby, they’ll be better for it. If they decide to pursue tech further, they’ll already have a head start, with projects and habits that employers respect.

## The Coach’s Role

Think of this like athletics, but for the mind. My job as coach is to cheer them on, help them set the right pace, and make sure they understand the game they’re playing.

One way I describe it to my own kids is the difference between donuts and broccoli. Donuts are what we chase without being told — quick, sweet, entertaining. Broccoli takes more getting used to, but it actually nourishes. At Meeplitis, I’m helping students discover that “broccoli work” — focused practice, building apps, solving problems — can be enjoyable too. It’s not empty screen time; it’s screen time that trains persistence, creativity, and confidence.

Belts mark milestones along the way, showing parents and students alike that progress is being made, slow and steady.

## The Bottom Line

Meeplitis is more than an after-school club. It’s a safe, structured place for your child to turn screen time into something purposeful: a chance to create, to focus, and to try on skills that could shape their future.
