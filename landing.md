# Meeplitis

Meeplitis is a club for making games and apps — a third place where creatives belong, build, and flourish.  Although play is part of it, the deeper reward comes from learning the craft of turning ideas into working things.

Everyone fits here: beginners, tinkerers, and seasoned builders alike. It’s an at-your-own-pace journey, but mostly about the shared community and fun. That’s why board games are a centerpiece and even [inspired the name](./name.md) — they remind us that play belongs at the heart of making. Alongside coding and games, you’ll also get a taste of artificial intelligence, which is fast becoming an essential skill for the next generation.

Come hang out, play some games, and learn how tech can be fun and creative — and maybe even a path to work that feels just as rewarding.

We meet on a steady rhythm:

* **Club** — three Thursdays a month, 4:30–6:30pm, September through May
* **Community Game Day** — first Sunday of the month, 12:00–5:00pm, year-round

If this sounds interesting, we invite you to take the next step...
