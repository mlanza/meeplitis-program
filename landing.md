# Meeplitis

Meeplitis is a club for making games and apps — a third place where creatives belong, build, and flourish.  Although it includes play, the work that goes into learning to be a maker showcases how rewarding making a reality what first started as just an idea.

Everyone fits here: beginners, tinkerers, and seasoned builders alike. It’s an at-your-own-pace journey, but mostly about the shared community and fun. That’s why board games are a centerpiece and even inspired the name — they remind us that play belongs at the heart of making. Alongside coding and games, you’ll also get a taste of artificial intelligence, which is fast becoming an essential skill for the next generation.

Come hang out, play some games, and learn how tech can be fun and creative — and maybe even a path to work that feels just as rewarding.

We meet on a steady rhythm:

* **Club** — three Thursdays a month, 4:30–6:30pm, September through May
* **Community Game Day** — first Sunday of the month, 12:00–5:00pm, year-round

If this sounds interesting, we invite you to take the next step...
