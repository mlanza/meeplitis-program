# Tools

A **personal computer** and **Internet** are essential instruments of digital making.  To participate in the club, members need regular access to them.

Furthermore, they'll need an **email account**.  This permits them to create secondary accounts, all free on [GitHub](https://github.com), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and [Yucata](https://yucata.de).  The instructor will lead students to create these when the time comes.

## Personal Computer

Development work requires a proper computer. Chromebooks and tablets won’t cut it. A desktop at home is workable, though it can’t be brought to class, which limits collaboration.

**What matters most is regular access.** The computer doesn’t need to belong to the student, so long as they can reliably practice on it.

That said, a **laptop is preferable**. Portability lets students bring their work to meetups, collaborate more easily, and keep momentum between sessions. Families often treat this as a progression—starting with whatever computer is available, then considering a laptop of their own if the student shows commitment. This “small bets” approach both rewards effort and eventually provides the tool that best supports growth.

The operating system doesn’t matter—Windows, Mac, or Linux are all fine.

## GitHub

This provides students with a place to keep and share their class work.  It enables the coach to review it.  It affords the opportunity to create issues, what is effectively a public forum for constructive feedback from others in the club including the instructor.

## ChatGPT

There are many AI tools, but ChatGPT is the standard we’ll use. Free accounts provide limited daily use—usually enough. If limits are exceeded, students can rotate among other free chatbot providers (Grok, Perplexity, Meta).

## Yucata

[Yucata](https://yucata.de) is a site for playing turn-based board games online. Since it mirrors the kinds of games we’ll play in sessions—and the type of app members may build for advanced belts—it’s a worthwhile way for them to explore and practice. I treat it as another way of dangling a carrot and keeping things fun.
