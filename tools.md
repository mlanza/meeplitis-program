# Tools

To participate in the club, members need access to:

* Laptop
* Internet
* Email account
* [GitHub](https://github.com) account
* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) account
* [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com) account

The accounts required for participation are free. Though premium accounts can be helpful for the most industrious students, they're not required. They're strictly optional.

It may be wise to keep a copy of your child’s account credentials for the email account and the chatbots they choose to register for. Knowing you can check in is itself a good deterrent against irresponsible use. Ultimately, you know your child best.

## Laptop

Development work requires a proper computer. Chromebooks and tablets won’t cut it. A desktop is workable, but it can’t be brought to class, which limits collaboration.

**Bringing a laptop to class is helpful—ideal even—but not required.** The minimum is having regular access to one at home. Think of it like a piano: [practice happens best](./growth.md) with steady time on the instrument.

## Internet

Internet access is essential for learning from others, reading, watching tutorials, and using services like GitHub and ChatGPT.

**As always, please continue to take the safety measures you normally would for responsible use.**

## Email Account

Needed to sign up for the secondary services like GitHub, ChatGPT and BGA.

## GitHub Account

This provides students with a place to keep and share their class work.  It enables the coach to review it.  It affords the opportunity to create issues, what is effectively a public forum for constructive feedback from others in the club including the instructor.

This will be created during class. Students only need an email address beforehand.

## ChatGPT Account

Like GitHub, this account will be created in class. An email address is required.

There are many AI tools, but ChatGPT is the standard we’ll use. Free accounts provide limited daily use—usually enough. If limits are exceeded, students can rotate among other free chatbot providers (Grok, Perplexity, Meta).

The paid plan of ChatGPT ($20/mo.) can be worthwhile to students so devoted to making progress they are routinely exceeding the free-tier daily limits.

## Board Game Arena Account

Like GitHub, this account will be created in class, using an email address. Creating it is optional, but it’s free.

Board Game Arena lets students play turn-based board games online. Since it mirrors the kinds of games we’ll play in sessions—and the type of app members may build for advanced belts—it’s a worthwhile way for them to explore and practice.
