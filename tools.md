# Tools

To participate in the club, members need regular access to:

* Personal computer (laptop preferred but not required)
* Internet

They'll need to create an email account if they don't already have one. That will permit them to create several secondary accounts, all free.  There should be nothing you need to do to facilitate this, but just to keep you in the loop here are the accounts we'll create:

* [GitHub](https://github.com) account
* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) account
* [Yucata](https://yucata.de) account

The instructor will lead students to create these as the time comes.

Although [Family Link](https://families.google/familylink/) provides a limited number of safety measures, **it may be wise to keep a copy of your child’s account credentials**. Knowing you can check in is itself a good deterrent against irresponsible use. Ultimately, you know your child best.

## Personal Computer

Development work requires a proper computer. Chromebooks and tablets won’t cut it. A desktop at home is workable, though it can’t be brought to class, which limits collaboration.

**What matters most is regular access.** The computer doesn’t need to belong to the student, so long as they can reliably practice on it. Think of it like a piano: [growth comes from steady time at the instrument](./growth).

That said, a **laptop is preferable**. Portability lets students bring their work to meetups, collaborate more easily, and keep momentum between sessions. Families often treat this as a progression—starting with whatever computer is available, then considering a laptop of their own if the student shows commitment. This “small bets” approach both rewards effort and eventually provides the tool that best supports growth.

The operating system doesn’t matter—Windows, Mac, or Linux are all fine.

## Internet

Internet access is essential for learning from others, reading, watching tutorials, and using services like GitHub and ChatGPT.

**As always, please continue to take the safety measures you normally would for responsible use.**

## Email Account

Needed to sign up for the secondary services like GitHub, ChatGPT and Yucata.

## GitHub Account

This provides students with a place to keep and share their class work.  It enables the coach to review it.  It affords the opportunity to create issues, what is effectively a public forum for constructive feedback from others in the club including the instructor.

## ChatGPT Account

There are many AI tools, but ChatGPT is the standard we’ll use. Free accounts provide limited daily use—usually enough. If limits are exceeded, students can rotate among other free chatbot providers (Grok, Perplexity, Meta).

The paid plan of ChatGPT ($20/mo.) can be worthwhile to students so devoted to making progress they are routinely exceeding the free-tier daily limits.

## Yucata Account

[Yucata](https://yucata.de) is a site for playing turn-based board games online. Since it mirrors the kinds of games we’ll play in sessions—and the type of app members may build for advanced belts—it’s a worthwhile way for them to explore and practice. I treat it as another way of dangling a carrot and keeping things fun.

The fun aspect of this account is not meant to overshadow the use of the working accounts.  As a rule of thumb, let's say 10 minutes a day a few times a week, as a reward for doing the work.  Again, you know your child and whether they can use this responsibly.
