# Rhythm

**Meeplitis runs on a steady rhythm of club sessions and community game days.**

* **Club (3x/month, during the school year)**

  * 1st, 2nd, & 3rd Thursdays, 4:30–6:30pm
  * Focus: coding, projects, and belt progression
  * Occasional game-based sessions that mix learning with play
  * Runs September–May (aligned with the school calendar)

* **Community Game Day (1x/month, year-round)**

  * First Sunday of the month, 12:00–5:00pm
  * Open to the public, built around [modern board games](https://whiletruelearnplay.com/introduction-board-gaming/)

## Extras Along the Way

Beyond the regular schedule, expect occasional **extracurricular activities** — special workshops, guest sessions, or offsite events — offered a few times throughout the year. These are optional but give members more chances to connect, learn, and play.

## Seasons

* **Club:** School year only (September–May)
* **Community Game Days:** Continue year-round, even through summer
