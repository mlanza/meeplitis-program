# For Young Adults: Keep Creating, Keep Belonging

**If you enjoy making things — and especially if games have always been your way to imagine, puzzle, and play — this is a place you can keep going.**

Meeplitis is where games meet code, and it doesn’t stop being fun just because you’ve left school behind. Some of us make for a career, others just for the joy of it. Either way, this is a community where belonging and building go hand in hand.

This isn’t about climbing a ladder and leaving. You may “graduate” through the belts, but graduation here doesn’t mean goodbye. You can stick around, keep creating, and even give back.

## What We Do Together

We learn by making. That means hands-on projects where ideas turn into something real. Belts still mark your progress, but you’re free to treat them as milestones, not finish lines. The joy is in continuing to create — coding a game for the challenge of it, experimenting with AI because it’s fun, or helping someone else over a hurdle.

Mentorship is part of mastery here. If you’ve climbed a rung higher, you’re encouraged to reach back. That doesn’t mean a long-term mentor/mentee bond — more like sharing what you know, when you can, so others grow too.

### Belonging With Boundaries

Because this is a mixed-age community, there are layers of safety you need to take seriously. If you’re 25 or older, background checks are required. For everyone, we keep a safe buffer — camaraderie, encouragement, and collaboration are all welcome, but personal closeness that could develop toward or be misread as intimate isn’t. This isn’t meant to scare you off. It’s part of what keeps Meeplitis a safe place for all.

## Hobbyist or Coach?

Some young adults will move on when life pulls them elsewhere. Others will stay, just because making is fun. That’s welcome. And if you’re aging out but still love it here, you may want to start thinking about coaching. Coaching is how you become part of the official team. Those spots are limited, but they’re open to any skill level — coaching is about presence, safety, and encouragement, not being the most advanced developer in the room.

## Why AI Matters

We’re living through an AI revolution. ChatGPT is one of the defining tools of this moment, and it’s the one you’ll use here. It will help you brainstorm, debug, and accelerate your making. But AI won’t do the work for you. You’ll learn to *understand* what you build, so you can extend and adapt it later — the kind of skill that lasts, whether or not tech becomes your career.

## The Payoff

The first time you see your own game or app actually work, it feels big. That thrill doesn’t fade just because you’ve done it before. Each project is its own milestone — proof you’re still growing, still making, still part of the community.

## The Invitation

If reading this has you thinking *“I’d like to be part of this”* — the best way to jump in is with our **Boot Camp** starting **Thursday, January 8, 2026**.

For some, this will stay a hobby. For those who really enjoy what they find here, [becoming a coach](./volunteers.md) may be the next step. Either way, you’re invited to belong here — making, sharing, and building alongside others who enjoy creating too.
