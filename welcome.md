# Welcome to Meeplitis

I’m glad you’re here. Meeplitis is a “third place” for makers and creatives — a community where you’ll learn, build, and belong. Our sessions mix coaching, practice, and projects that grow over time. You’ll find challenge here, but also encouragement and friendship. Bring your curiosity, your laptop, and a willingness to practice — the rest we’ll grow together.
