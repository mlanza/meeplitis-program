# How Growth Works Here

Few things in life are as satisfying as being able to imagine something, build it, and share it with others.

Meeplitis gives you the chance to learn from those ahead of you, including your coach. A weekly meetup can only provide so much class time — not nearly enough to cover the full range of skills you’ll try out here.

There’s no set pace except the one you choose. Like learning piano, you won’t grow without regular practice. That means putting in steady weekly hours: building skills, doing hands-on exercises, and most importantly, creating and sharing your own apps or digital games. To mark your progress, the course uses [ascending belts](./earning-belts.md) — like karate belts — to show your foundation is solid.

Early deliverables are designed to be fun. This program is built around board and card games, so play is always part of the mix. But growth still requires commitment and effort.

Making things is full of unknowns. Every project is a mix of learning new concepts, troubleshooting what breaks, and actually building something that works. It’s rarely a straight path forward — progress often feels slow, with detours and dead ends along the way. But that’s normal.

As the old proverb reminds us:

> How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.

The important thing isn’t racing ahead, it’s steady steps. Each small win — a bug fixed, a feature built, a new idea understood — moves you forward.

There’s a lot to learn, but you don’t need to know everything. You just need to start — and keep learning. Exploration is part of the work. None of us are rocket scientists; if I can do it, you can too.

Class time alone won’t take you all the way. My role as coach is to teach you how to learn, and to help you know what to tackle next. Don’t be intimidated. Set your own pace. Stick with it, and I’ll guide you toward your next milestone, your next belt. It’s work, but it’s meant to be fun.

This is a golden opportunity to enjoy a constructive pastime, to see if you find joy in bringing ideas into reality. It’s a safe proving ground where you can explore making as a hobby — and along the way, you’ll pick up skills that are valuable in today’s world. If later you decide to head toward a career in tech, you’ll already have a solid head start. But the first question is simpler: does creating spark something in you?
