# Meeplitis Charter

## Why Meeplitis Exists

Creatives need a [third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)—a community beyond home and school where they belong, create, and are invested in. Jocks have their teams; musicians have band and orchestra. Geeks and makers deserve a place too.

Meeplitis is that place: a church-hosted, after-school program of fun, belonging, and skill-building in the world of technology and games. Here, young people learn to harness artificial intelligence, coding, and problem-solving—not just as skills, but as tools for creativity, community, and flourishing.

The name Meeplitis comes from the world of board games, and that’s intentional. Playing and making games is both the on-ramp and the goal: games make learning tech fun, and building them becomes the proving ground of real skills. Members gather to play, to code, and to create together—while also being cared for as people made in God’s image.

## Value Propositions by Audience

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**
> Class time gives makers the tools to solve problems and push through challenges on their own. It provides coaching and direction, but [lasting gains come through personal practice and persistence](./growth.md)—like learning piano, it takes rhythm and routine outside the lesson.

### For Students & Young Adults

* A safe, fun, and welcoming “third place” to belong as a geek or creative.
* Hands-on learning in real tech skills (AI, command line, Git, web development, problem-solving).
* A ladder of progression with belts, challenges, and milestones to celebrate growth.
* The joy of making real deliverables, from small apps to full board games.
* Opportunity to give back—mentoring peers and shaping the next generation.

### For Parents

* A productive and enriching use of time, with less aimless screen time and more purpose.
* Early career exploration—members can “try on” tech before committing to secondary schools.
* Inexpensive exposure to skills that open doors to stable, well-paying jobs.
* A community that also invests in character, resilience, and healthy outlooks.
* Clear safety measures: vetted volunteers, background checks, and parental guidance forms.

### For Church Leadership

* A ministry that embodies love: putting others’ needs ahead of our own.
* Authentic community witness—not making projects out of people, but caring for them.
* Outreach to an underserved group: creatives and geeks who often fall between the cracks.
* A visible, innovative expression of Bible Baptist Church’s mission to love and serve the community.
* Light footprint: regular meetings, volunteer involvement, direct accountability to Outreach Pastor Brian Eichelberger.

## Identity

* **Name:** Meeplitis
* **Core Expression:** A third place for makers, coders, and creatives.
* **Common Bond:** Learning and using tech to make apps and games
* **Hosted by:** Bible Baptist Church, under the supervision of Outreach Pastor Brian Eichelberger.
* **Faith Integration**: Meeplitis follows the spirit of [Why at the Well](https://whyatthewell.org)—opening doors to the community with members’ flourishing at the center. The focus is on tech, problem-solving, and belonging. Because I am shaped by Christ, I will naturally speak in Bible-influenced ways. That influence is present, but always secondary to the promise of the program.

## Structure

The ministry [rhythm](./rhythm.md) is club and community game days:

* **Club:**

  * Primary focus: skill development, projects, belts progression.
  * Members are expected to arrive with their own laptops, ready to work.
  * One Wednesday each month may run as a *hybrid* session—mixing learning with games to build community.

* **Community Game Days:**

  * Open to the general public as a board game community event.
  * Serves as an on-ramp and outreach opportunity for non-members, e.g. the public at large.

* **Membership:** Open to teenagers through twenty-somethings. Requires basic computer literacy, laptop access, and ability to use AI tools like ChatGPT.

* **Cycle:** Weekly during the school year; summers off. Ongoing membership encouraged, even after “graduation.”

* **Leadership:** Led by a primary coach (founder), supported by vetted volunteers. Reports directly to the Outreach Pastor.

## Intended Outcomes

* **Problem-Solving Mindset:** Learning to break big problems into smaller ones and persist when things break.
* **Scrappy Learners:** Building confidence in self-teaching, adapting, and tackling the unknown, often using AI to attack problems.
* **Delivering Work:** Tangible projects tied to belt progression, celebrating creativity and follow-through.
* **Joy in the Journey:** Coding as play—treating challenges like puzzles and taking pleasure in the process.
* **Belonging and Mentorship:** A family of friends who share work, teach each other, and celebrate wins.
* **Character and Ethic:** Growth in resilience, humility, service, and collaboration, rooted in a God-honoring outlook.
* **Ongoing Community:** Space for graduates and advanced members to keep making, teaching, and contributing.

## Values

* **Belonging:** Everyone deserves a place to belong and be cared for.
* **Making:** Creativity expressed through building, coding, and finishing projects.
* **Progression:** Clear milestones that gamify growth and reward persistence.
* **Mentorship:** Advanced members help those behind them; teaching is part of mastery.
* **Safety:** Background checks, vetted volunteers, parental guidance forms, and accountability.

* **Religious Identity & Autonomy**: Meeplitis is a ministry of Bible Baptist Church. While the program welcomes all without regard to belief, it is led and directed in accordance with the church’s Biblically-based values. Leadership, policies, and practices shall remain consistent with the church’s sincerely held religious convictions. Participation is open, but nothing in the operation of Meeplitis shall be understood to limit the program’s freedom to act in alignment with those convictions.

* A place where geeks and creatives belonged.

* A community where faith quietly underpinned care and love.
