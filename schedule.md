# Schedule

All meetups, when scheduled, will appear here.  It will also mention anything special you need to remember to bring, outside the regular stuff.

**Urgent Messaging.** If we need to cancel or shift a meeting on short notice, a text alert will be sent to the number you listed as scheduling contact on the **welcome form**. Make sure that number is current and belongs to someone who can receive texts.
