# Incremental Skill Building

The aim is to develop a comprehensive understanding of various skills and tools that are essential for building modern web applications but having fun doing it by including small games as milestones. The proficiencies target the fundamentals and then add programming and libraries and the deploying of working web apps.

I am taking an incremental learning approach, seeing each skill as a hole needing filled, and gradually filling 3-5 holes with knowledge and experience in a round-robin fashion, just enough to take on and complete a series of small projects.  The projects and exercises serve to build muscle memory and confidence and to slowly build competence.

I am targeting a solo-developer mindset, not collaboration.  I am helping them become generalists.

🌱 = Fundamentals
🌳 = Advanced skills

## Meta-Skills 🌱

Tech is continuous learning and problem solving.  You will often not know the answer.  The essential attitude is to anticipate the unanticipated and having a readiness to work through it.

### Learning to learn 🌱

* Curiosity and persistence
* Breaking problems down
* Being scrappy: finding multiple ways to solve a problem
* Evaluating tradeoffs between “good enough” and “ideal”
* Knowing when to read docs vs. experiment vs. ask for help

## Visuals

I'll mention the possibilities although the DOM will be the focus.

* DOM rendering
* Canvas drawing basics
* SVG for scalable 2D work
* 3D as a category mention (context-setting only)

### HTML 🌱

* Basic structure, tags, forms, semantic elements

### CSS 🌱

* Styling, layout (flexbox/grid), responsive mindset
* Animations
* Transitions

## Artificial Intelligence 🌱

### Chatbot 🌱

* Prompting for debugging, idea-generation, explanations
* The general use of AI

### Agentic Coding 🌳

* Prompts AI to generate specs
* Prompts AI to write code

## Programming

### JavaScript 🌱

* Variables, functions, control flow
* Arrays/objects
* Structuring data
* Dynamic DOM manipulation
* Event loop, sync/async, promises
* Error handling (try/catch, debugging patterns)
* Testing

### Atomic

* Object-oriented programming
* Functional programming
* Functional core - start with simulation
* Imperative shell - the UI comes later

## Tools & Workflow

### VS Code (Text Editor) 🌱

* Editing, extensions, debugging basics

### Logseq (Note-taking) 🌱

* Note-taking, personal knowledge capture

### Command line 🌱

* Navigation, scripts, package management (npm/deno)

### Git 🌱

* Init, clone, add/commit, push/pull, branching basics

### Browser DevTools

* Inspecting, console, network tab

### Deployment 🌳

* Cloudflare Pages
* Cloudflare Workers
* Supabase

### Project Structure

* Files/folders, entry points, organizing assets

## Runtime & UI

### Deno (with mention of Node)

* Running scripts, using imports, basic CLI apps

## APIs & Networking 🌳

* REST fundamentals
* `fetch` in JS
* JSON data handling
* Client/server model

## Persistence 🌳

### Data storage

* LocalStorage and browser storage basics
* File persistence (where possible with Deno)
* Database introduction (Supabase or similar, later stage only)
