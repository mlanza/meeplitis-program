# 🥋 Earning Belts

The belts are tied to the student's ability to produce tangible deliverables at a certain level.  As the club also mixes board games in — in part to keep things fun — it's a natural part of the belt progression.

* ⬜ **White** — Empty slate
* 🟨 **Yellow** — Static website
* 🟧 **Orange** — Turn-based game or app
* 🟩 **Green** — Realtime game or app
* 🟦 **Blue** — Traditional board/card game (You've graduated!)
* 🟪 **Purple** — Modern board/card game
* 🟫 **Brown** — Feature development
* 🟥 **Red** — Deployment & ops
* ⬛ **Black** — Refactoring & architecture

The first few deliverables matched to belts are metrics to prove your abilities, but they're not necessarily the only things you'll have built.  You may have to work on and produce a number of small projects to build the skills you need to tackle belts.  That's okay.  There's no rush.  Learn to walk before you run.

The **orange belt** is significant as its the one where programming becomes the primary endeavor.  It's where you learn to think like a developer and to make ideas into realities.  If you can earn it, even if you chose to remain here and make a few turn-based games, I'm confident you can earn the blue belt.

You earn a **blue belt** to validate you have what it takes to make developing a profession and to graduate Meeplitis University.  It'd be worth the mention on your resume.  The other belts exist for those who choose to stick around for the joy of the community and/or hobby.

## Meeplitis

[Meeplitis](https://meeplitis.com) (the public facing website) represents the product of the “employer” in this path. That’s why certain dictates are mentioned, like the use of Atomic for developing the UI of apps. While technology offers endless libraries to choose from, in real professional settings you’re often given a set of expectations — specific tools, libraries, and languages — that form your boundaries. A key skill is learning to abide by those requirements and to work effectively within those lines.

## Mentorship

A core value of this program is service. Life is helping those behind us reach the places we’ve already been. Your role as a member is not just to think of yourself, but to look out for those around you and support their growth. Whatever your belt, your responsibility is to collaborate, to puzzle through problems together, and to share what it takes to produce real deliverables.

Always be kind. Everyone learns at different paces and in different ways. There is no shame in what someone hasn’t yet mastered. Be patient, encourage one another, and remember that progress is a shared journey.

## Belts

### ⬜ White Belt

The following skill form the baseline for producing digital deliverables. These are skills we begin developing day one in boot camp and beyond.  They are the basis of the habits you take into every project, no matter the level:

* **AI assistance (e.g., ChatGPT):** for debugging, brainstorming, explanations, coding, just about anything.
* **Note-taking (Logseq):** capturing ideas, tracking progress, and planning projects.
* **Text editor (VS Code):** your primary workspace.
* **Version control (Git + repositories):** essential for history and safe iteration.
* **Project structure:** organizing files, folders, and assets clearly.
* **Command line:** running scripts, managing packages, and moving through the system.
* **Web pages (HTML & CSS):** the foundation for anything visible on the web.

From the outset, you will be thinking about and honing an array of skills, but you don't need to have mastered any.  See each as a hill you begin climbing, but whose top you never reach.

### 🟨 Yellow Belt

Create an aesthetically pleasing web site or blog using HTML and CSS.  Laying out images and text.  Capable of telling the story of a game using a collage of images.

You begin to learn programming to continue on and earn further belts.

* **JavaScript:** the programming language which underpins the web.
* **Atomic:** front-end development library, central to the FC/IS approach.
* Introduce object-oriented programming
* Introduce functional programming
* Introduce the functional core, imperative shell approach

At this stage you've glimpsed the essential fundamentals offered by the program.

### 🟧 Orange Belt

Choose a small app or game like [Sokoban](https://mlanza.com/sokoban/).

### 🟩 Green Belt

Choose a small app or game like [Boulder Dash](https://mlanza.com/boulder-dash/).  Introduce an extra dimension of complexity, like realtime play.

### 🟦 Blue Belt

Choose a traditional board or card game from the public domain like [Up & Down the River](https://meeplitis.com/games/up-down/).  Introduces `fetch` and Supabase persistence.

You learn to plug a new game into an existing platform with a fixed infrastructure decided by the company.  The important learning is to understand the limitations of the platform and how to work within them.

You will learn to submit a pull request.

### 🟪 Purple Belt

Choose a modern board or card game like [Mexica](https://meeplitis.com/games/mexica/).

This is similar to the previous belt, but with more complexity and a focus on a modern game and intellectual property owned by some brand.  You would have to choose a game a contact the third-party vendor and get their approval.  The coach can help facilitate.

### 🟫 Brown Belt

You are no longer just adding a new piece, but extending the platform.  You go to the coach and he will assign you a feature. You will need to learn to assess the impact of the change.  You learn how to report to the customer and fulfill their requirements.

## Confirming the Belt

There are two key moments surrounding each belt.  Deciding what you're going to build to earn the belt and then submitting the completed work.

Each belt offers a general target and a set of requirements.  But there's some flexibility in selecting what you want to shoot for.  The coach requires you to pitch your idea before you start.  He wants to ensure it's neither too easy nor too hard.

When you submit work for a belt, the goal isn’t just to produce something that runs—it’s to show you understand what you built. AI tools can help you experiment and get ideas moving, but in the real world, code is a living thing. Employers expect you to maintain and adapt it, not just deliver a one-off.

That’s why your coach may ask you to walk through your project, explain choices you made, or extend it in some way. This isn’t meant to trip you up. It’s to confirm you can stand on your own feet. If the work is truly yours, explaining and/or extending it should feel natural.

## Custom Paths

The belts through blue are fixed; however, beyond that the path can be customized.  The advanced belts offer a progression suitable to an employee of "the company," one that ships online board games, thus the site.  However, if you want to deviate from that path and develop products for yourself, I support that. My goal is your flourishing.  I provide a reasonable path for you to follow, but I will help you tailor another.  The only requirement is the path provides a sufficient progression of layered on complexity and depth to justify the level.
