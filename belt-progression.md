# ü•ã Belt Progression

The belts are tied to the student's ability to produce tangible deliverables at a certain level.  It begins with small projects and requiring just a few skills at early stages.  Different projects with different combinations of skills.

* **White** ‚Äî Empty slate
* **Yellow** ‚Äî Static Website
* **Orange** ‚Äî [Sokoban](https://mlanza.com/sokoban/)
* **Green** ‚Äî [Boulder Dash](https://mlanza.com/boulder-dash/)
* **Blue** ‚Äî [Traditional Board/Card Game](https://meeplitis.com/games/up-down/)
* **Purple** ‚Äî [Modern Board/Card Game](https://meeplitis.com/games/mexica/)
* **Brown** ‚Äî Feature Development
* **Red** ‚Äî Deployment & Ops
* **Black** ‚Äî Refactoring & Architecture

I suggest earning a **blue belt** validates you have what it takes to make developing a profession.  The one who earns it is said to be a Graduate of Meeplitis University.

## Meeplitis

[Meeplitis](https://meeplitis.com) (the public facing website) represents the product of the ‚Äúemployer‚Äù in this path. That‚Äôs why certain dictates are mentioned, like the use of Atomic for developing the UI of apps. While technology offers endless libraries to choose from, in real professional settings you‚Äôre often given a set of expectations ‚Äî specific tools, libraries, and languages ‚Äî that form your boundaries. A key skill is learning to abide by those requirements and to work effectively within those lines.

## Mentorship

A core value of this program is service. Life is helping those behind us reach the places we‚Äôve already been. Your role as a member is not just to think of yourself, but to look out for those around you and support their growth. Whatever your belt, your responsibility is to collaborate, to puzzle through problems together, and to share what it takes to produce real deliverables.

Always be kind. Everyone learns at different paces and in different ways. There is no shame in what someone hasn‚Äôt yet mastered. Be patient, encourage one another, and remember that progress is a shared journey.

## Belts

### White Belt

The following skill form the baseline for producing digital deliverables. These are skills we begin developing day one in boot camp and beyond.  They are the basis of the habits you take into every project, no matter the level:

* **AI assistance (e.g., ChatGPT):** for debugging, brainstorming, explanations, coding, just about anything.
* **Note-taking (Logseq):** capturing ideas, tracking progress, and planning projects.
* **Text editor (VS Code):** your primary workspace.
* **Version control (Git + repositories):** essential for history and safe iteration.
* **Project structure:** organizing files, folders, and assets clearly.
* **Command line:** running scripts, managing packages, and moving through the system.
* **Web pages (HTML & CSS):** the foundation for anything visible on the web.

You will be thinking about and honing all of them, but you don't need to have mastered any.  See understanding each as a hill you begin climbing but whose top you won't ever reach.

### Yellow Belt

Create an aesthetically pleasing web site or blog.  Laying out images and text.  Capable of telling the story of a game using a collage of images.

You begin to learn programming to continue on and earn further belts.

* **JavaScript:** the programming language which underpins the web.
* **Atomic:** front-end development library, central to the FC/IS approach.
* Introduce object-oriented programming
* Introduce functional programming
* Introduce functional core, imperative shell

At this stage you've glimpsed the essential fundamentals offered by the program.

### Orange Belt

Choose a small app or game like Sokoban.  Introduce Atomic.  Introduce the functional core in Deno or browser. Finish the core before fleshing out the imperative shell and UI.

### Green Belt

Choose a small app or game like Boulder Dash.  Introduce realtime play.

### Blue Belt

Choose a traditional board or card game, one in the public domain.  Introduces `fetch` and Supabase persistence.

### Purple Belt

Choose a modern board or card game.  Increases complexity.  Requires the buy-in of the vendor.
