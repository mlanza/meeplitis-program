# Policies

Meeplitis is committed to creating a safe and welcoming space for students. This page explains how we handle emergencies, photos, technology use, and liability. **Your signing the welcome letter is your authorization and agreement with everything that appears here.**

## Emergency & Medical

Emergency contacts and medical notes are collected on the **welcome letter**. By completing that section and signing, parents/guardians authorize Meeplitis staff or volunteers to seek emergency medical treatment if needed, should a parent or guardian be unreachable.

## Photo & Media

Photos or short videos may occasionally be taken during Meeplitis sessions. These may be showcased within Bible Baptist Church to share highlights of student creativity and community life. They are **not posted online or shared publicly**. Families who prefer no photography or video at all may let us know in writing, and we will honor that choice.

## Technology & Internet Use

Students use laptops and online tools, including AI platforms, as part of their projects. Responsible use is expected, and activities are guided by coaches and volunteers. Families acknowledge that creativity here may involve coding platforms, AI, and internet-connected resources.

## Liability & Safety

While Meeplitis provides a structured and supervised environment, participation involves ordinary risks of group activities. By signing the **welcome letter**, parents/guardians release Meeplitis, its volunteers, and host facilities from liability for accidental injury or loss, except in cases of gross negligence.
