# Where the Name Came From

If you play modern board games, you probably already know the *meeple*. It’s that chunky little wooden person who stands in for you on the board—your avatar in the world of cardboard adventures. If you don’t play games, well, now you know: meeples are the tiny mascots of play itself, beloved by hobby gamers everywhere.

The name *Meeplitis* began as a playful twist, as if you could “catch” the meeples. The *-itis* ending usually marks an illness—bronchitis, meningitis, that sort of thing—but here it was just for fun: the “affliction” of loving games.

But as the idea grew, the word stretched beyond the joke. Now I see *Meeplitis* more like a place than an affliction. Imagine a bustling city of creativity, built on games, coding and making. It’s a home for that inner spark—the part of you that lights up at puzzles, tinkering, inventing, and play.

For those who hear the call, Meeplitis isn’t just a name. It’s where your love of games and making finds a community to belong to.
