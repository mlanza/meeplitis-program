# Safety

Meeplitis is built on trust. Safety is a shared responsibility between our volunteers and families. This page explains how we approach that responsibility.

## Volunteers and Young Adults

* All adult volunteers must have current background checks in place.
* Young adults who continue participating after age 25 are required to meet the same standard.
* We strive for accountability in every setting: activities are supervised, and we avoid one-on-one private interactions.

## Internet Use

* Students work online to code, research, and collaborate. All the usual internet safety precautions apply.
* Families are encouraged to keep oversight in place at home, just as they would for other internet activity.

## Email and Accounts

* Students will create accounts for classwork (GitHub, ChatGPT, Yucata).
* Work shared in GitHub projects and surrounding conversations are **public by design**. Families can freely monitor their children's accounts.
* An email account is needed to sign up for these services. We encourage families to **keep a copy of their child’s credentials**. The knowledge that accounts can be checked at any time is often enough to deter misuse.
* Occasional spot checks are recommended, not as a routine but as a safeguard.

## AI and Generative Images

* Students should avoid using AI which has not been endorsed by the instructor.  At this time that's ChatGPT.
* The general rule is to request your child not generate images except as it relates to completing assignments.
* AI that can generate images pose the same risks your familiar with when it comes to the Internet. ChatGPT has reasonable safety measures but is not perfect.
* Families are encouraged to set boundaries at home that keep students away from dedicated generative image sites and. It is the instructor’s sentiment that little good comes from those sites.
