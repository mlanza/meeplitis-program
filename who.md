# Who Belongs at Meeplitis

Meeplitis exists as a **third place for makers, coders, and creatives** — a community beyond home and school where belonging, growth, and the joy of making come together. We welcome a wide net of participants, but with clear pathways that keep the culture safe, healthy, and true to our mission.

Technology isn’t just for one age group. Some discover it in middle school, some later in high school, and others only after a false start in college or early career. Meeplitis is built to make room for all of these paths:

| Who              | Ages  | Description |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---- |
| [**Students**](./students.md) | 12–22 | Middle school, high school, and traditional college-age learners. |
| [**Young Adults**](./young-adults.md) | 23–29 | Still exploring or pivoting, ready to sharpen skills in a safe, structured community. |
| [**Coaches**](./volunteers.md) | 18+   | Trusted adults who step into a vetted support or leadership role. |

## Background Checks

This wide net allows Meeplitis to serve both teenagers finding their footing and young adults rethinking their direction — without losing sight of safety or belonging.

**To this end, background checks are mandatory for all coaches and members 25 or older.**

This structure ensures that anyone beyond “student age” is either moving toward a checked, trusted role or already serving as a coach.

## Mentorship as a Core Philosophy

At Meeplitis, **mentorship is not a title — it’s a practice.** Everyone who has climbed one rung higher is expected to reach back and help the person behind them. Teaching and guiding are part of mastery.

This philosophy naturally creates intergenerational overlap: older participants invest in younger ones, and younger members learn to invest in peers as they grow. What could feel like a gap instead becomes a living ladder of support.

## A Place Worth Staying

Meeplitis is more than a training ground; it’s also a hobbyist club, a community where making itself is celebrated. Some will push through belts as a step toward careers in tech. Others may stick around simply because they love building games, experimenting with AI, or completing the next creative challenge. Both are valid.

The club exists as a **third place of belonging** — a home for the joy of making, where professional-grade work and play coexist. Here, skills that the marketplace prizes are learned in an environment that treats creation as fun, not just labor.
