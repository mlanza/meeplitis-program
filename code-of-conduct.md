# Meeplitis Code of Conduct

*Meeplitis is a third place where creatives belong, build, and flourish.*

> **Note on Values**
> Meeplitis is hosted by [Bible Baptist Church](https://www.bbcpa.org). The program exists to help members grow in technology, creativity, and community. That is always the focus. Because leaders are shaped by Biblical convictions, faith-informed perspectives may surface at times, but they are not the main agenda of the program.

*By joining Meeplitis, members agree to uphold the following expectations:*

## Respect Others & Their Work

* Encourage peers. No put-downs, bullying, or mean talk.
* No coarse language or taking the Lordâ€™s name in vain.

## Honor Leaders & the Space

* Follow instructions promptly.
* Treat church and personal equipment with care.

## Stay Safe & Appropriate

* No weapons, drugs, or alcohol.
* Stay in supervised areas unless told otherwise.
* Respect personal boundaries.  There's no place for romantic behavior or flirting.

## Use Devices Wisely

* Phones and laptops are for the task at hand.
* Keep them off or silent when not in use.

## Participate with Joy

* Engage in learning, games, and collaboration.
* Contribute to the atmosphere of fun and encouragement.

## Understand the Consequences

* First misstep: gentle reminder.
* Continued issues: parents notified.
* Serious or repeated behavior: possible removal from the program.

## Acknowledgment

I have read and understood the Meeplitis Code of Conduct. I agree to abide by these expectations and the consequences of not.
