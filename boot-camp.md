# Boot Camp

Boot Camp is 6 sessions with the first starting **Thursday, January 8, 2026**. It gives you a **holistic overview** of everything we’ll be exploring in the club, from the fundamentals of coding and web development to the creative use of AI to make apps and games. Think of it as your guided tour of the maker’s toolkit.

## Required

Access to an Internet-connected personal computer is central what club is about. A laptop is ideal since it can be brought along to sessions, but a desktop at home is still workable. When you come, bring:

* Laptop (if possible)
* Notepad and pencil
* Email address

The email address enables us to create a couple  accounts essential to what we learn in class.

## What We’ll Touch On

Each week spotlights a different corner of the skills you’ll need as a maker:

* **Web Basics** — how to shape content with HTML and CSS so you can bring ideas to life on screen.
* **Programming** — JavaScript essentials that let you build logic and interactivity into your projects.
* **AI Tools** — using chatbots and agentic coding to brainstorm, debug, and speed up your learning.
* **Games & Visuals** — from simple DOM projects to canvas drawing, creating fun as a path to skill.
* **Workflow Tools** — VS Code, Git, and command line basics so you can work like a real developer.
* **Deploying & Sharing** — how to put your projects on the web for others to see and play.

By the end, you’ll have a clear sense of the journey ahead and the confidence to keep building.

## Annual Rhythm, Open Doors

Boot Camp runs every year. It’s the smoothest on-ramp — but you don’t have to wait for it. New members can join the club anytime, participate, and get a feel for the community. Coaches and peers will help you find your bearings and ease into the rhythm.
