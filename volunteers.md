# For Volunteers: A Place to Invest in Creatives

**Meeplitis only works because adults choose to show up.**

## Why Volunteers Matter

Meeplitis is a third place for makers and creatives — a safe, structured community where young people can belong while building real skills in coding, AI, and game design. None of that happens without adults present.

If students are in the room, I need at least one other adult alongside me. Your presence makes the difference between a session running or being canceled. Safety comes first, and volunteers make it possible.

## What Meeplitis Is

This isn’t another generic after-school program. It’s for the kids who often feel like outsiders — the ones who don’t fit into the rhythms of sports or band but come alive when making, puzzling, or imagining.

Athletes have their teams. Musicians have their ensembles. But creatives — the geeks, the makers, the artists — are often underserved. Meeplitis exists to change that: a community where belonging comes through shared interests, not forced agendas.

If you’ve seen *The Chosen*, you may remember Matthew: gifted, different, always on the edge of the crowd. Many of our students feel the same way. Meeplitis is the community I wish I’d had — a place where creativity is normal, difference is welcome, and growth is celebrated.

## When We Meet

See the [schedule](rhythm.md). There are two kinds of shifts:

* **Club nights** — 2 hours, three Thursdays a month (school year).
* **Community game days** — 5–6 hours, one Sunday each month (year-round).

Serve in either, or both.  I can facilitate on and off months.

## What You Bring

The only non-negotiable is a willingness to be present, care about people, and pass standard child-safety checks. Everything else is bonus:

* You like [modern board games](https://whiletruelearnplay.com/introduction-board-gaming/) or are at least open to learning them.
* You’re in tech, or tech-curious, and would enjoy being around coding projects.
* You’re drawn to art and creativity, and want to see students thrive in that space.
* You’re interested in learning alongside students — volunteers can engage with the same material if they choose.

## The Bottom Line

Meeplitis is about belonging, safety, and growth. For students, it’s a proving ground to develop skills the marketplace values. For volunteers, it’s a chance to invest in a group that rarely gets a home: young creatives.

Ask yourself: *Does this strike a chord with me? Do I remember wishing something like this had existed when I was younger? Do I resonate with Matthew — gifted, different, often on the fringe?*

If you feel any of that in yourself, this may be a ministry fit. Serving here isn’t about making people projects. It’s about walking with students around common interests, meeting their needs in the very way you once longed for yours to be met.

## Going The Extra Mile

For most, showing up and being present is the win. But if you’re the kind of creative who finds joy in more — more collaboration, more ideation, more ways to shape a program so people feel cared for — I’d love to talk.

This isn’t about giving more time, but about trading ideas and working thoughtfully together. If that resonates, let me know and we can start a dialogue. And if, after the conversation, you realize it’s not for you, that’s fine — no strings attached.

This invitation isn’t for everyone. It’s for the right person who feels the tug to help evolve what Meeplitis can be.
